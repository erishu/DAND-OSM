The city I chose to investigate is Lowell, MA, an old mill town that is currently the fourth largest city in Massachusetts with a population of about 110,000.

I chose Lowell because I grew up not too far from there. Recently, a friend told me that he had taken a trip to Lowell for vacation. I hadn’t been there in years, and I was curious as to how the city had changed.
